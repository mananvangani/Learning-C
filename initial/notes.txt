##to open a c or c++ compiler in vs code it has to be launched from the developer tools to code 


##the developer tools are the command propmt of vs code and need the basic commands such as 
-cd to navigate 
-mkdir to make a new dir
-code . = to make a new code file for c/c++

##vscode itself has these condensed settings that it needs for the compilers to run under .vscode which are also pushed to git 
which i believe sooner or later i will be able to exclude as i havent seen them in many repos

## starting git on a new device requires telling git the global user name and global email

## straight away cloning a repo doesnt work for c/c++ , need to start from developer commands of vs code and clone over there only to 
use them


## need to check what these red files with many extensions mean and why they are created each time
