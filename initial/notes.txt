##to open a c or c++ compiler in vs code it has to be launched from the developer tools to code 


##the developer tools are the command prompt of vs code and need the basic commands such as 
-cd to navigate 
-mkdir to make a new dir
-code . = to make a new code file for c/c++

##vscode itself has these condensed settings that it needs for the compilers to run under .vscode which are also pushed to git 
which i believe sooner or later i will be able to exclude as i haven't seen them in many repos

## starting git on a new device requires telling git the global user name and global email

## straight away cloning a repo doesn't work for c/c++ , need to start from developer commands of vs code and clone over there only to 
use them


## need to check what these red files with many extensions mean and why they are created each time
 ans - It seems that .ilk and .exp files can be deleted, and it works just as well, as long as you're using .lib and .dll. 
 They will be generated each time you compile the project in Visual Studio (in Debug mode).
  They're not needed if you start the application using a batch file that reads: start /d .. MyProjectName_Debug.exe
   (which sets the "working directory" there). Those files are used for incremental linkage when using the "Edit and Continue"
    feature of Visual Studio

## about git keys = SSH 
    An SSH key is an access credential for the SSH (secure shell) network protocol. This authenticated and encrypted secure network protocol is used for remote communication between machines on an unsecured open network. SSH is used for remote file transfer, network management, and remote operating system access. 
    The SSH acronym is also used to describe a set of tools used to interact with the SSH protocol.

    SSH uses a pair of keys to initiate a secure handshake between remote parties. The key pair contains a public and private key. 
      The private vs public nomenclature can be confusing as they are both called keys. It is more helpful to think of the public key as a "lock" and the private key as the "key".
    You give the public 'lock' to remote parties to encrypt or 'lock' data. 
    this data is then opened with the 'private' key which you hold in a secure place.
